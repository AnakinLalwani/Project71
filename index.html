			<h2 class="text1 text">My School</h2>
			<h4 class="text1">
				Don Bosco Matunga, is an English medium school run by the Salesians of Don Bosco. This institution meant primarily for Catholics is established and administered by the Catholic Church but it is open to all irrespective of religion, caste or creed. The school is recognised by the Government of Maharashtra.<br><br>

				Don Bosco is perceived as a school apart, for it has a fine blend of academics, sports and culture. Considering the numerous activities that take place all the year round one wonders when the teaching and learning is done. Well, the secret is precise pre-planning with perfect execution and behold, you have a NEAT job done in every arena. A true testament to this claim are the innumerable laurels won by the students in every field. Don Bosco sends up on an average over three hundred students and secures a nearly cent percent result. This in itself speaks volumes about the overall academic performance of the school. Each standard has its syllabus meticulously charted in the syllabus book which also contains formats of the Test/Exam papers along with the distribution of marks. Every child is given this book at the beginning of each academic year. This enables the teachers to efficiently execute the syllabus and aids the parents to follow the work systematically done in school.</h4>

				In 1937, the general council of Salesians of Don Bosco approved a plan to buy 60,000 square yards (50,000 m2) land in Matunga from the Bombay Municipal Corporation. The Corporation approved the sale on 16 July 1937. The Don Bosco High School (formerly known as The Catholic Educational Institute) run by them was moved from the rented premises at Tardeo to the new Don Bosco campus at Matunga.

				Fr Aurelius Maschio was the main pillar behind the creation of the school. The land brought from the Bombay Municipal Corporation was marshland which was filled with debris to be able to build the school which started off at a partially completed building on 31 October 1941 and later officially inaugurated on the 31 January 1942. This building still serves as the Main/Secondary section of the school.

				The foundation stone of the primary section building was blessed and laid on the feast of Don Bosco 31 January 1950. The building was completed in time for the new school year of June 1951. The architect were the famous and well renowned Patki and Dadarkar. All stained glass were imported from Italy. The then Pope, Pius XII had come for the opening.

				The Shrine of Don Bosco's Madonna, which is located in the school campus at Matunga, was opened on 5 August 1957. The church is credited as being one of the architectural high points of the suburb.
